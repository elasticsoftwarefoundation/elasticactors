/**
 * Listener that can tap in to Rebalancing events. When the cluster topology changes the ElasticActors framework will
 * start to rebalance. By using implementing this listener, and calling
 * {@link org.elasticsoftware.elasticactors.ActorSystems#registerRebalancingEventListener(RebalancingEventListener)}
 * a Actor will be able to get rebalancing events.
 *
 * This is mainly useful for {@link org.elasticsoftware.elasticactors.ServiceActor}s and should be used with care on
 * normal {@link org.elasticsoftware.elasticactors.Actor}s as it imposes overhead on the rebalancing logic it is
 * running on the same thread that handles the rebalancing itself
